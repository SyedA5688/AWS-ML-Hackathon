# AWS-ML-Hackathon
Machine learning model approaches created for AWS-NVIDIA Environmental Hackathon, August 2020.

Includes a main autoencoder data reconstruction approach for anomaly detection, as well as a side
exploration of anomaly detection with the Isolation Forest Algorithm.

Libraries used: Pytorch, torch.nn, pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, time, os, random, joblib, pathlib
